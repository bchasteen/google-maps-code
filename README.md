## Google Maps code
Some google maps examples I downloaded.  These are using PHP to replace the Google access key and to create the index.php files which lists each directory's contents.

### Directions
* create a .etc folder
* create a key.json file inside the .etc folder with the following contents:
```
{"key" : "YOUR-API-KEY"}
```
once this is created then the pages should display correctly.
